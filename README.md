This program will move the matched files only after comparing between source and destination folders into a third folder.
The path detials are specified by the user.
The movement of files will be from source folder into new folder with matched files.

Input details required:
1. Source folder path
2. Destination folder path
3. Folder path to store matched files.

Currently, the program only moves the matched files from the specified folder into another folder with matched files 
which can be further enhanced for nested folders as well.
